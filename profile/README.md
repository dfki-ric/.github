This is a collection of open source software developed by the
[Robotics Innovation Center (RIC)](https://robotik.dfki-bremen.de/en/startpage.html)
of [DFKI GmbH](https://github.com/dfki) (German Research Center for Artificial
Intelligence GmbH).

In addition to the software under this organization, DFKI RIC also released
and maintains software in other GitHub organizations. Here is an overview of
both.
